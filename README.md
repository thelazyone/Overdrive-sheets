# Overdrive-sheets
A fast and dirty procedural builder to generate ship sheets for Full Spectrum Overdrive


## Running it Locally
You need a working version of python 3.x, with pillow and svglib installed (no venv)
Run it by calling `python ship_creator.py` or to target a specific ship model `python ship_creator.py --ship your_ship_model.json`

Ship jsons are structured in a fairly simple way. A proper documentation is required for the future.
